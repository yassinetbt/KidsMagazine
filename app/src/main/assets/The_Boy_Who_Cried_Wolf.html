<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Once upon a time, there lived a shepherd boy who was bored watching his flock of sheep on the hill. To amuse himself,</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">, he shouted, “Wolf! Wolf! The sheep are being chased by the wolf!” The villagers came running to help the boy and save the sheep. They found nothing and the boy just laughed looking at their angry faces.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">“Don’t cry ‘wolf’ when there’s no wolf boy!”, they said angrily and left. The boy just laughed at them.</span><br /> <br /><span style="color: #000000;">After a while, he got bored and cried ‘wolf!’ again, fooling the villagers a second time. The angry villagers warned the boy a second time and left. The boy continued watching the flock. After a while, he saw a real wolf and cried loudly, “Wolf! Please help! The wolf is chasing the sheep. Help!”</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">But this time, no one turned up to help. By evening, when the boy didn’t return home, the villagers wondered what happened to him and went up the hill</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">. The boy sat on the hill weeping. </span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">“Why didn’t you come when I called out that there was a wolf?” he asked angrily. “The flock is scattered now”, he said.</span><br /> <br /><span style="color: #000000;">An old villager approached him and said, “People won’t believe liars even when they tell the truth. We’ll look for your sheep tomorrow morning. Let’s go home now”.</span><br /> </p>
